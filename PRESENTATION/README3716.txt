CS3716 FINAL PROJECT GROUP 1


github: https://github.com/mikewhite1996/CS3716/tree/master/PRESENTATION

Our application can be ran from the executable .jar file included in the submission. Our application allows a administator to
create a schedule for the fall and/or winter semesters, by specifying the semester, day, room and times. The user will be limited
to submitting requests specifically only for the times created in the schedule. The schedule stays persistent, so when
the application is reopened, the previously created schedule will still be available. 

The principal may also select the times for a day to be NOT AVAILABLE - NOT AVAILABLE which will show the user that if they submit a request
for this time it will not be approved.

The user then can submit a request, by entering their name, picking the semester, then the room, then the day, along with
a priority from 1-5, which then will display only the times that are previously created on the schedule as vaild time submissions.

The submitted requests are then displayed.

If the user wishes to create more requests, they can simply exit the submitted requests display and resubmit another request.
